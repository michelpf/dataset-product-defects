# Product Defects

This dataset was originally downloaded from [Kaggle]([https://dadosabertos.tse.jus.br/dataset/resultados-2020-boletim-de-urna](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rrighart/jarlids)).

The goal of this repository is to facilitate the teaching of Python classes with organized data.

The current dataset contains 168 image files with a total of 1859 jar lids, an average of 11 per image. Categories include intact (962) versus damaged jar lids (897). Types of damages are lid deformations, holes, and scratches. An annotation file with bounding boxes is added.

This dataset was adapted for use in Machine Learning classes.
